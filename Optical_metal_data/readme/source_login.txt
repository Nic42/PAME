-------------------


Sopra nk files have a special format which is explained at address below:

http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/FreeSnell/FreeSnell_2.html

Essentially the first number in the header indicates the spectral unit (ev=1, um=2, cm=3, nm=4 I think), second number is start value, third number is stop value and fourth number is the total number of data points.  Not really sure why they do this...


nk.py is used to read the header, deterimine the energy unit and spacing and transform to wavelength in nm then output data 
in a nice format.  This program has only been verified to convert EV properly, and may not work for the other units (aka um) without bugs.  

jk.py was written especially for johnson and christy data which is simply tab-delimited:

lambda	n	k
1.937	0.92	13.78
1.610	0.56	11.21
1.393	0.43	9.519

There are certainly some differences in the plots given for the JC vs SOPRA files.
