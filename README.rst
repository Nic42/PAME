Tutorials
=========

PAME's tutorials are a series of screencasts that illustrate a series of simulations.  The resulting simulations are analyzed in IPython notebook tutorials.
    - Screencast 1: `Introduction to PAME- Anti-reflective coatings`_

Installation
============

Binaries installers are `under development <https://bitbucket.org/anthony_tuininga/cx_freeze/issue/127/collectionssys-error#comment-15016355>`_, but for now, PAME must be installed as a python library and launched through the command line.  Anyone interested in helping to develop binaries, please contact us.
