Bugs:

11/29
When changing material in nanosphere shell, when volume fraction is changed, mview shows shell material not core/shell.  
This also is probably responsible for the strange scattering cross sections

Fixed:  No


CompositeMaterials/Specparms?: Changing the xunit causes everything to go crazy in the mixer

Fixed: No

mview/AllViews:  Even though everything is updated, if user is looking a a material when that material is changed, the plot doesn't refresh (module is updating) but user had to click off view to 
refresh.  This is also happening for mview.


Hazards:

basic_material:
	file_x and file_n used to store data from files, but not file_e exists.  earray is updated automatically from narray, but there's never an instance of file_e,
	so if reading file type with dielectric data, need to update the basic_file module

DrudeNew, DrudeNP_corrected:
	Need to set property "Nanomaterial" in self (that is, self.Nanomaterial=self) because the object is a NanoSphere, even though drude should just describe a raw material.
	The problem is that the dielectric is dependent on R for size correction

NanoSphereShell:
	The medium material and shell material solvent are being syncronized!
	Everything's so muddled that the core object is not necessarily being sent into mie

Mie: Bessel function is warning of taking real arguments, does this mean the bessel functions aren't using the complex arguments for the nps?

12/4
Specparms:  When changing units, xstart/xend change but then don't change back if change again it seems...


Next Version Cleanups:
-Need to cleanup conv/main_parms since it's weird how main_parms uses lambdas to initialize conv and interact with it.
-Instead of syncing specparms and modeltree (especially modeltree) should be able to initialize with it because these should not change (Although if
using copied traits, do these ever get copied and changed?  Should copy these as shallow references or not at all)
